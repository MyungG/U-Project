## Development Background
1. With the advent of the untact era, the dependence on delivery and delivery food increases
2. Due to Corona, it is burdensome for both delivery driver and recipient to exchange food face-to-face
3. Food can be received while the recipient is absent, reducing the risk of loss of the parcel
